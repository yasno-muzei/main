It consists of two wings, which are separated by a tripartite triumphal arch adorned by sculptors Stepan Pimenov and Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky and commemorating the Russian victory over Napoleonic France in the Patriotic War of 1812. The arch links Palace Square through Bolshaya Morskaya St. to Nevsky Prospekt. Until the capital was transferred to Moscow in 1918, the building served as the headquarters of the General Staff (western wing), Foreign Ministry and Finance Ministry (eastern wing). The western wing now hosts the headquarters of the Western Military District. The eastern wing was transferred to the Hermitage Museum in 1993.","address":"Дворцовая пл., 6-10","rating":"9.1"},{"title":"Russian State Arctic and Antarctic Museum","category":"Science and Natural History","wikilink":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_and_Antarctic_Museum","foursquare":"https://ru.foursquare.com/v/%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%83%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B9-%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%B8-%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8/4db40e31fc607e0aa231bc63","description":"The museum is located in Avraam Melnikov's Neoclassical church from the 1820s and remains the largest museum dedicated to polar exploration in the world.
